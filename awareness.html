				<h1>The Stigma Surrounding Mental Health</h1>
        <h3>Mental health is an increaisngly relevent and important topic and yet, we often don't treat it as such. People often don't realize just how common mental illness is, and this leads to profound negative effects. Mental health stigma can be traced back to lack of understanding or fear. People with mental health problems are among the least likely of any group with a long-term health condition or disability to: <ul>
  <li>find work</li>
  <li>be in a steady, long-term relationship</li>
  <li>live in decent housing</li>
  <li>be socially included in mainstream society</li>
</ul></h3>
        <h3> Through this interactive statistical visualization, we hope to raise awareness for the general public and destigmatize the topic of mental health. </h3>
